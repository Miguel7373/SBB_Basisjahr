  <p>Apfelschorle (Apple Spritzer), also Apfelsaftschorle (Apple juice spritzer) or Apfelsaft gespritzt (Splashed
    apple juice, more widely used in Hessen, Bayern, and Austria) in German, is a popular soft drink in
    Switzerland, Germany, and Austria.</p>
  <p>It consists of carbonated mineral water and apple juice. The broader category Fruchtschorle consists of any
    fruit juice mixed with carbonated water, but Apfelschorle is by far the most common. Spritzer (that is, wine
    mixed with carbonated water) is called Weinschorle.</p>
